# Marginalisation

Given a [joint distribution](202210081156) $p(x,y)$, the marginal distribution
of $x$ is defined by
$$
p(x) = \sum_{y} p(x,y)
$$
Note that $p(x)$ is a distribution: it is non-negative. Also 
$$
\sum_{x} p(x) = \sum_{x} \sum_{y} p(x,y) = 1
$$

More generally, we can define a marginal by summing over 1 of more variables, 
$$
p(x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, \ldots, x_n) = \sum_{x_i} p(x_1, \ldots, x_n)
$$
