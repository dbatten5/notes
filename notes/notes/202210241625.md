# STAT0032 Group Project

**Make sure you know your audience.** Shouldn't assume very advanced statistical
knowledge.

A test we need might not be one we're familiar with already, worthwhile
exploring more tests and also having a chat with Oscar the supervisor.

Need to ensure you know why you are using a particular test. What are the
assumptions? Why is it appropriate for this situation? What are the limitations?
