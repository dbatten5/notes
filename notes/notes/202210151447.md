# T-test

A form of [hypothesis testing](202210150928.md), motivated by small sample sizes,
[normally distributed](202210091114.md).

For example, consider the concentration of barley in Guinness samples, with

$$
X_i \backsim N(\mu, \sigma^2), \hspace{1em}  i = 1, 2, \ldots, n
$$

We would like to know if we are correctly manufacturing the Guinness with a
target mean barley concentration of $\mu_0$.

Therefore we formulate the hypothesis as:

$$
H_0:\mu = \mu_0, \hspace{0.5em}  H_1: \mu \ne \mu_0
$$

The test [statistic](202210101627.md) is proposed as

$$
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{\sqrt{n}(\overline{X}_n - \mu_0)}{S_n} \backsim \mathcal{T}(n - 1) \\[0.5em]
\overline{X}_n &: \text{sample mean} \\[0.5em]
S_n &: \text{sample standard deviation}
\end{align*}
$$

This is known as the **student-t** distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
For large $n$ it is essentially a $\text{Norm}(0, 1)$ distribution.
