# Hypothesis testing for linear regression

A possible $H_0$ for a [linear models](202210111445.md) could be all the
parameters $\beta_i = 0$, i.e. there is no linear relationship between the
covariates and the output. Or in other words, is there any association of any
kind between input $Y$ and $X_i$ **given the other inputs**?

### Using the F statistic

One way to test this is with the [F statistic](202210281421.md). Note that
$\mathbb{E}[\text{numerator}] = \sigma^2$ and, under $H_0$,
$\mathbb{E}[\text{denominator}] = \sigma^2$. Therefore, under $H_0$, our
F statistic should be "close" to 1.

To decide on what "close" is:
* Find the distribution of $F$
* Asses the probability (w.r.t. the data distribution) that $F > 1$
* Reject $H_0$ if this is smaller than the agreed test level

Note that $\mathbb{E}[(TSS - RSS)/p] > \sigma^2$ if $H_0$ is false.

Also note that this does not suggest that the model is good.

If the [p-value](202210151020.md) is high, there is evidence that predictor $X_i$ 
does not explain the variability of the outcome *give the other predictors*.
This is not he same as input $X_i$ not being important.
