# Two camera geometry

An epipolar line is the projected line of a ray from one camera onto another
camera.

Multiple epipolar lines induced on camera 2 (by camera 1) intersect at the
epipole (for camera 2), which is a projection of the optical center (pinhole)
from camera 1 onto camera 2. Note that the if the cameras are lined such that
the epipolar lines are parallel, the epipole will be at infinity.
