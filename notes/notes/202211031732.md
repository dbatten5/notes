# Viterbi

For a [HMM](202210261811.md), and suppose we have witnessed a given state. The
Viterbi algorithm gives us the most likely sequence of hidden states to give us
the observed state.

Suppose we have $v \in \left\{ A, B, C \right\}$ and we have observed 
$P = AABCBA$. At every time step, we work out what is the most likely path that
ends in a certain state at time $t$.

$$
\delta_j(t) = \max \left\{ \delta_j(t-1)A_{ij}B_j(t) \right\}
$$

Where $A$ is the transition matrix and $B$ is the emission matrix.
