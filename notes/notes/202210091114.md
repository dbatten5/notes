# Univariate normal distribution (Gaussian)

The univariate normal distribution has a pdf:

$$
P(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp \left[ 
\frac{-0.5(x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2}
\right]
$$


Written as
$$
P(x) = \text{Norm}_x[\overbrace{\mu}^{\text{mean}}, \underbrace{\sigma^2}_{\text{variance}}]
$$

The distribution of the 2 variables $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ follows the [Normal inverse gamma distribution](202210091117.md).
