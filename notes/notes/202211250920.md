# Regression splines

Fit separate (low-degree) polynomials over different regions of the input space.
This is called a *piecewise* model.

Most common building block: cubic polynomials

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + \beta_2x^3 + \epsilon
$$

The point in the input space where the coefficients change is called a *knot*,
e.g.

$$
Y = \begin{cases}
\beta_{01} + \beta_{11}x + \beta_{21}x^2 + \beta_{31}x^3 + \epsilon, \text{ if } x < c \\
\beta_{02} + \beta_{12}x + \beta_{22}x^2 + \beta_{32}x^3 + \epsilon, \text{ if } x \ge c
\end{cases}
$$

Often that leads to a jump in the fitted curve (at the knot(s)). We can
reconcile this by enforcing an "agreement" at the knot

$$
\beta_{01} + \beta_{11}c + \beta_{21}c^2 + \beta_{31}c^3 =
\beta_{02} + \beta_{12}c + \beta_{22}c^2 + \beta_{32}c^3
$$

Note that this gives us one fewer degree of freedom (in this case we're left
with 7). Often you'll want to have the enforce agreement of the first and second
derivates at the knot

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta_{01} + \beta_{11}c + \beta_{21}c^2 + \beta_{31}c^3 &=
\beta_{02} + \beta_{12}c + \beta_{22}c^2 + \beta_{32}c^3 \\[0.5em]
\beta_{11} + 2\beta_{21}c + 3\beta_{31}c^2 &=
\beta_{12} + 2\beta_{22}c + 3\beta_{32}c^2 \\[0.5em]
2\beta_{21} + 6\beta_{31}c &=
2\beta_{22} + 6\beta_{32}c
\end{align*}
$$

The result is a *cubic* spline, with $4 + k$ DoF for $k$ knots.

These constraints can be a burden, so an alternative is to do **change of 
representation**. Suppose we had $k + 3$ basis functions:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1b_1(x) + \beta_2b_2(x) + \ldots + \beta_{k+3}b_{k+3}(x) + \epsilon
$$

Then for each knot $\xi$,

$$
h(x,\xi) \equiv (x - \xi)^3_+ = \begin{cases}
(x - \xi)^3 \hspace{1em} \text{if } x > \xi \\
0 \hspace{4em} \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The coefficients are now unconstrained.

## Choosing the knots

Typically they are placed uniformly in the range of x.
