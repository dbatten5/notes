# Extended Kalman filter

The regular [Kalman filter](202211281348.md) assumes the temporal and
measurement equations to be linear. The EKF allows for situations when the
relationship is non-linear:

$$
\begin{align*}
\bold{w}_t &= \bold{f}\left[ \bold{w}_{t-1}, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_p \right] \\[0.5em]
\bold{x}_t &= \bold{g}\left[ \bold{w}_t, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_m \right] \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$

The key idea is to take the Taylor expansion and treat as locally (at the peak
$\boldsymbol{\mu}_t$) linear.
