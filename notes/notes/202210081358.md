# Binomial distribution

This is for an experiment with two outcomes where a random variable $X$
describes some outcome of the experiment.

For example, tossing a coin $n$ times and seeing how many heads are received. If
the probability of getting a head is $p \medspace (= 1 - q)$ and $\Omega = \{H,
T\}^n$, the total number $X$ of heads takes values in the set $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
Its probability mass function $f(x) = P(X = x)$ satisfies
$$
f(x) = 0 \enspace \text{if } x \notin \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n\}
$$

Consider $f(k)$. Exactly $\binom{n}{k}$ points in $\Omega$ give a total of $k$
heads, each of these points occurs with a probability $p^kq^{n-k}$, and so
$$
f(k) = \binom{n}{k}p^kq^{n-k} \enspace \text{if } 0 \le k\le n
$$

The random variable $X$ is said to have the binomial distribution with
parameters $n$ and $p$, written bin$(n,p)$. The special case where $n=1$ is
known as the [Bernoulli distribution](202210081016.md). $X$ can therefore be
written as a sum $X = Y_1 + Y_2 + \ldots + Y_n$ of $n$ Bernoulli variables.

The [expected value](202210081500.md) is $np$ and the [variance](202210081517.md)
is $npq = np(1 - p)$.
