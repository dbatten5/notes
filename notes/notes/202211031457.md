# Convolutional neural network

A neural network with layers of [convolutions](202211031343.md). The filter
weight gradients can be updated (learned) with backpropagation.

For a kernel size $K$, input size $D_{in}$, padding $P$ (each side) and stride
$S$, the output dimension $D_{out}$ is given as:

$$
D_{out} = \frac{D_{in} - K + 2P}{S} + 1
$$

Typically we'll have $S=1$ and $K=2P + 1$ so the output size is the same as the
input.
