# d-connected/separated

$\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are *d-connected* by $\mathcal{Z}$ if there is
any path from $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathcal{Y}$ that is not blocked by $\mathcal{Z}$.
If $\mathcal{Z}$ is the empty set then $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are
d-connected.

If all of the paths are blocked then we $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are
*d-separated* by $\mathcal{Z}$.

Note that d-separation and connection are properties of the graph (not of the
distribution).

d-separation implies that $X \perp Y | Z$, but d-connection does not necessarily
imply the conditional dependence.
