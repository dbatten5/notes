# Deviance

A measure of fit based on the likelihood function. Very closely related to
[maximum likelihood](202210101331.md).

Called deviance because it is defined as a contrast of the desired model against
the [saturated model](202211041034.md). A lower deviance will *typically* mean a
better fit, e.g. adding a useless predictor will lower the deviance.

Useful for testing model comparison, or whether your model is a reasonable model
(by comparing it to another model).
