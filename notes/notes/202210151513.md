# Hypothesis testing independence

We wish to test whether two discrete variables are [independent](202210071208.md).
The [chi-square test](202210151517.md) would be an appropriate test, for every
combination of the two variables we may compare the frequency of co-occurrence
against the product of the [marginal](202210091450.md) frequencies.
