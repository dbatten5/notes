# Fitting Markov models

## Discrete variables

### Single series

For a first order stationary [Markov chain](202210201823.md), the [maximum likelihood](202210101331.md) corresponds to setting the transitions by counting the number of observed transitions in a sequence:

$$
P(v_T = i|v_{T-1} = j) \propto \sum_{t=2}^{T} \mathbb{I}\left[ v_t = i,
v_{t-1} = j \right]
$$

Where $\mathbb{I}$ is the identity function.

### Multiple series

For a set of [time-series](202210261714.md) $v_{1:T_n}^n, n = 1, \ldots, N$, the
transition is given by counting all transitions across time and datapoints.
