# Selecting a hypothesis

If we make stronger assumptions with the consequence of reducing our set of
alternatives we may increase the power of our test.

For the example in [Hypothesis testing](202210150928.md), we said
$$
H_0: \theta = 0.5 \\[0.5em]
H_1: \theta < 0.5 \\[0.5em]
$$

But we could instead say:
$$
H_0: \theta = 0.5 \\[0.5em]
H_1: \theta \ne 0.5 \\[0.5em]
$$

If we do this, we need to update our definition of more extreme (updating our
critical region). In the above update, we need to convert this test to a *two
sided test*, where very small and very large values are considered extreme. Our
critical region is then the union of the two sets, for $c_z$ the $z^{\text{th}}$
quantile of the distribution under $H_0$

$$
\begin{align*}
\left\{ X \le c_{0.025} \right\} &\cup \left\{ X \ge  c_{0.975} \right\} \\[0.5em]
\left\{ X \le 13 \right\} &\cup \left\{ X \ge 27 \right\}
\end{align*}
$$

This is known as a **two-tailed test**.
