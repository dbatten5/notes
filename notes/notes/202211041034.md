# Saturated model

A situation where each data point $y^{(i)}$ has its own parameter
$\theta^{(i)}_{sat}$

$$
\hat{\theta}^{(i)}_{sat} = y^{(i)} \hspace{0.5em}  \forall i
$$

In practice this is a bad idea ([overfitting](202210061205.md)). However, it
does all us to derive a useful summary [statistic](202210101627.md) with known
asymptotic distribution.

$$
D \equiv 2\left[ l(\hat{\beta}_{sat}) - l(\hat{\beta}) \right] 
\hspace{1em} D \backsim \chi^2_{n-p}
$$

Where $l(\beta)$ is the log likelihood of the model using [ML](202210101331.md).
So $D$ is a chi-squared distribution with $n-p$ degrees of freedom.

Can think of a non-saturated model as one which is nested within a saturated
model. $M_2$ is nested in $M_1$ if both have the same inputs, but $M_2$ has some
of the parameters $\beta$ set to 0. This allows us to compare two models and we
can use [hypothesis testing](202210150928.md) to test whether $M_2$ is a
reasonable model. One way to do this is test the ratio of the ML estimates,
known as the *log-likelihood ratio*:

$$
D \equiv 2\left[ l(\hat{\beta}_{M_1}) -l(\hat{\beta}_{M_2}) \right] \hspace{1em} 
D \backsim \chi_k^2
$$

Here, $k$ is the difference in number of parameters between the two models.
