# Particle filtering

Allows for [temporal estimation](202211281313.md) but with multi-modal
distributions over the state.

Represents a probability distribution as a set of weighted particles in the
state space. Each particle can be thought of as representing a hypothesis about
the possible state.

No need for data association (where it's not obvious which aspect of the data
is the true measurement) required but it's expensive to compute.

## Condensation algorithm

$$
P(\bold{w}_{t-1}|\bold{x}_{1\ldots t-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} a_j \delta\left(
\bold{w}_{t-1} - \hat{\bold{w}}_{t-1}^{[j]}
\right)
$$

1. Resample from weighted particles according to their weight to get unweighted
   particles.
2. Pass unweighted samples through temporal model and add noise.
3. Weight samples by measurement density.
