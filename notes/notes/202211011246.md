# Bayesian non-linear regression

Like in [non-linear regression](202210251356.md), but instead the weights 
$\boldsymbol{\phi}$ are treated as uncertain. In learning we compute the
posterior distribution over these weights. For a new observation $\bold{x}^*$,
we compute the transformed vector $\bold{z}^*$ and compute an infinite weighted
sum over the predictions due to the possible parameter values.

See Prince book p.156 for the predictive distribution.
