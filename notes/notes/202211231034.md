# Missing data

For the asbestos x cancer x smoker network described in other examples, we now
consider the case where only partial information is available. E.g. for a
patient $n$ with a record $v_n = \left\{ c = 1, s = 1 \right\}$, it is known
that the patient has cancer and is a smoker, but whether or not they had
exposure to asbestos is unknown.

$$
p(v_n|\theta) = \sum_{a} p(a,s^n,c^n|\theta) =
\sum_{a} p(c_n|a,s^n,\theta_c)p(a|\theta_a)p(s^n|\theta_s)
$$

For hidden variables $h$, and visible variables $v$ we still have a well defined
likelihood

$$
p(v|\theta) = \sum_{h} p(v,h|\theta)
$$

We want to find the $\theta$ that optimise $p(v|\theta)$. Can use 
[expectation maximization](202210250932.md) for this since this is more
numerically complex compared to when al the variables are observed.
