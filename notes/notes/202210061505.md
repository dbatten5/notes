# Bias

This can relate to a large number of different things.

Can be used to describe patterns of [misfitting](202210061509.md) across different
types of model. This is known as the [bias-variance tradeoff](202210061513.md)

Also used to describe systematic skews in training data. For example a training
set of pictures of dogs and cats, but all the pictures of cats are in b&w and
the ones of dogs are in colour. The model may correlate b&w-ness with cat-ness
(of course this is incorrect).
