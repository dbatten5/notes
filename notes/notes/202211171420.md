# Mallow's Cp

Provides an estimate of test error, useful as a criteria in the 
[best subset selection algorithm](202211171401.md).

$$
C_p(S) \equiv \frac{1}{n}(RSS(S) + 2|S|\hat{\sigma}^2)
$$

Here, $S$ is the number of covariates and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the estimate of
error variance using all the covariates. Note that this only really applies to
linear regression.
