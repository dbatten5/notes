# Convexity

If a 1D function is convex, then it has only a single minimum. Can tell if a
function is convex by looking at $2^{\text{nd}}$ derivates, which would be
positive everywhere.

For higher dimensions, we need to examine the [Hessian matrix](202211011712.md).
If this is [positive definite](202210131406.md) everywhere, then the function is
convex.
