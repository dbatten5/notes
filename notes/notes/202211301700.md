# Mean field approximation

For [variational inference](202211301631.md), an approach for selecting a family
of "easy" distributions $Q$ is to select a factorized distribution:

$$
Q(x) = \prod_{n=1}^{N}q(x_n)
$$

To optimise the bound for this distribution, can use
[coordinate ascent](202211301702.md).
