# Basis projection

We can stack any number $n$ of data vectors $\bold{x}$ as rows in a design
matrix $\bold{X}$ and any number $p$ of $\bold{u}$ vectors as columns in a
projection matrix $\bold{U}$

$$
\bold{X} \in \R^{n \times d} \hspace{1em} \bold{U} \in \R^{d \times p}
$$

Then $\tilde{\bold{X}} = \bold{X}\bold{U} \in \R^{n \times p}$ is the projection
of the data onto the space of $\bold{U}$.

When doing this, we want to capture as much of the data variance as possible, so
it should align with whatever direction varies the most. The collection of these
directions are known as the principal components.
