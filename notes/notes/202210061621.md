# $\sigma$-field

A collection $\mathcal{F}$ of $\Omega$ is a $\sigma$-field if the following are
satisfied:
1. $\empty \in \mathcal{F}$
2. if $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^\infin A_i \in \mathcal{F}$
3. if $A \in \mathcal{F}$ then $A^{c} \in \mathcal{F}$

That is, the empty set is in $\mathcal{F}$, it's closed under countable union (and
intersection), and closed under taking the complement.

The smallest $\sigma$-field is $\{\empty, \Omega\}$.

Another not so small $\sigma$-field is $\{\empty, A, A^{c}, \Omega\}$, assuming
$A$ is a subset of $\Omega$.
