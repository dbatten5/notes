# Cross validation

Useful as a criteria in the [best subset selection algorithm](202211171401.md).

Split data into $K$ disjoint subsets. For every data subset $D_k$, where
$k = 1, 2, \ldots, K$, use the remaining data for fitting (training) the model,
and assess the [RSS](202210111531.md) on the "test set" $D_k$. Then report as a
score the model average $D_k$ across folds.
