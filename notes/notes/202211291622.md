# Smoothing (temporal models)

A form of [temporal estimation](202211281313.md) but instead of using just the
observations and state up until current time $t$ (called *on-line*), we make
use of future observations. E.g., looking at a video of a car accident and
trying to work out the velocity of a car at a given frame.

Fixed lag smoother is still intended for on-line estimation, but it delays the
decision about the state by a fixed number of time steps. We wish to calculate 
$P(\bold{w}_{t-\tau}|\bold{x}_{1\ldots t})$ where $\tau$ is the time lag.

Fixed interval smoother assumes that we have observed all of the measurements in
the entire sequence before we make a judgment about the world state. Instead of
calculating $P(\bold{w}_t|\bold{x}_{1\ldots t})$ we now estimate 
$P(\bold{w}_t|\bold{x}_{1\ldots T})$.
