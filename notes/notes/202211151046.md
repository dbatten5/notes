# Stereo vision

Concerns two images taken from slightly different positions. The matching point
in image 2 is on same scanline as image 1. The horizontal offset is called the 
*disparity*, and is inversely related to depth.

The goal is typically to infer the disparities $w_{m,n}$ at pixel $m,n$ from 
images $\bold{x}^{(1)}$ and $\bold{x}^{(2)}$.

Use likelihood:

$$
P(\bold{x}^{(1)}_{m,n}|w_{m,n} = k) = \text{Norm}_{\bold{x}^{(1)}_{m,n}} \left[
\bold{x}^{(2)}_{m,n+k},
\sigma^2 \bold{I}
\right]
$$
