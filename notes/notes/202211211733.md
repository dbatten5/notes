# Graph cuts

Used to optimise this cost function:

$$
\argmin_{w_{1\ldots N}} \sum_{n=1}^{N} U_n(w_n) +
\sum_{(m,n)\in \mathcal{C}} P_{mn}(w_m,w_n)
$$

Where $U$ is the unary term (compatibility of data with label $w$) and
$P$ is the pairwise term (compatibility of neighbouring labels).

Used for 3 main cases:

* binary [MRFs](202211211719.md) ($w_i \in \left\{ 0, 1 \right\}$) were the
costs for different combinations of adjacent labels are "submodular". Exact MAP
inference is tractable here.
* multi-label MRFs ($w_i \in \left\{ 0, 1, \ldots, K \right\}$) where costs are
"submodular". MAP inference is tractable here.
* multi-label MRFs where the costs are more general. Exact MAP inference is
intractable but approximate solutions can be found.

Submodular means that we can find the optimal solution of the overall problem by
looking at optimal solutions of subsets of the problem (and aggregating).

The approach is the following:

Convert minimization into the form of a standard CS problem,

[Maximum flow](202211211744.md) or [minimum cut](202211211745.md) on a graph.
