# Iterative non-linear optimization

For a target of

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = \argmin_{\theta}[f[\boldsymbol{\theta}]]
$$

* Start with an estimate for $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{[0]}$
* Take a series of small steps to $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{[1]},
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{[2]}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{\theta}^{[\infty]}$
* Make sure that each step decreases cost
* When we can't improve, must be at a minimum

Note that $f\left[ \bullet \right]$ is termed a *cost function* or 
*objective function*.
