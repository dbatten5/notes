# Hidden Markov model parameters

### Transition Distribution

For a stationary [HMM](202210261811.md), the transition distribution 
$P(h_{t+1}|h_t)$ is defined by the $H \times H$ transition matrix

$$
A_{i', i} = P(h_{t+1} = i'|h_t = i)
$$

And an initial distribution

$$
a_i = P(h_1 = i)
$$

### Emission Distribution

For a stationary HMM and emission distribution $P(v_t|h_t)$ with discrete states
$v_t \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, V \right\}$, we define a $V \times H$ emission
matrix

$$
B_{i, j} = P(v_t = i|h_t = j)
$$

For continuous outputs, $h_t$ selects one of $H$ possible output distributions
$P(v_t|h_t), h_t \in \left\{ 1, \ldots, H \right\}$ .
