# Decision trees

Want to learn the structure of the tree from the data. Can think of it as a
partition of the feature space. There are different ways of learning the
structure the tree:

- Recursive - build the tree one node at a time
- Greedy - not revisiting earlier choices
- Brute force search - check every value of every feature in the subset related
  to the current node

We are searching at each node for a split that maximises the reduction in some
loss over the child nodes relative to the parent.
