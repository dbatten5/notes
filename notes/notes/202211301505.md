# Autoencoders

Models where the inputs are also used as output labels, i.e. it's required to
output the same thing that is fed into it.

Can be thought of as an encoder-decoder pair. Encoder funnels input down to a
smaller dimension, decoder reconstructs the original from this low dimensional
code.
