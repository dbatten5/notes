# Unscented Kalman filter

Approximate distribution as a sum of weighted particles with correct mean and
covariance. Pass particles through non-linear function of form

$$
\begin{align*}
\bold{w}_t &= \bold{f}[\bold{w}_{t-1}] + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_p \\[0.5em]
\bold{x}_t &=  \bold{g}[\bold{w}_t] + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_m
\end{align*}
$$

Compute mean and covariance of transformed variables.
