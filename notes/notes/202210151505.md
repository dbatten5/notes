# Wald test

A form of [Hypothesis test](202210150928.md). This uses the same
[statistic](202210101627.md) as the [T-test](202210151447.md), but the interpretation
is different, and as a result the distribution of the test statistic also
differs:

- samples can be from "any" distribution
- sample sizes assumed to be "big enough" that the [CLT](202210151509.md) applies
- the distribution of the test statistic is therefore $\text{Norm}(0,1)$

Let $\theta$ be a scalar parameter, let $\hat{\theta}$ be an estimate of $\theta$
and let $\hat{\text{se}}$ be the estimated standard error of $\hat{\theta}$.

Consider testing

$$
H_0: \theta = \theta_0 \hspace{1em} \text{versus} \hspace{1em} H_1: \theta \ne
\hat{\theta}
$$

The size $\alpha$ Wald test is: reject $H_0$ when $|W| > z_{\alpha/2}$ where

$$
W = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_0}{\hat{\text{se}}}
$$

Where $z_{\alpha} = \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha)$. $\Phi$ is the standard [normal
distribution](202210091114.md) CDF, so the inverse gives the value associated
with a specific cumulative probability for the standard normal:

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
norm.ppf(0.5)  # = 0.0
```
