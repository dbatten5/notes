# Bias-variance Tradeoff

Here, bias refers to the tendency of a model to misfit due to model structure
or assumptions.

Variance is the tendency of the model to misfit because it's too sensitive to
the specifics of the training data.

A high bias model will tend to converge to similar, although likely wrong,
answers across differences in the training data. It imposes stronger
assumptions and may be prone to [underfitting](202210061504.md).

A high variance model will likely yield wildly different results for small
variations in the training data, an example of [overfitting](202210061205.md). On
average though, these answers may be closer to the real answer though. Variance
tends to make fewer assumptions.
