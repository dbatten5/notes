# Dynamic programming

Also known as the Viterbi algorithm, this is a tool to find the
[MAP](202210101339.md) solution to chain models, there needs to be a notion of
conditional independence and it can be set out as a graphical model (directed or
undirected). Also works for trees (graphical models with branching), but the
algorithm gets more complicated.

Note that we need discrete variables here.

If dynamic programming isn't feasible, can use belief propagation techniques,
e.g. [sum-product algorithm](202210271152.md). DP preferable though as it's
quicker to run. DP is not possible when e.g. there are loops, $\bold{w}$
is continuous.

The recipe looks like this:

1. Work through graph computing minimum possible cost $S_{n,k}$ to reach each
   node. A cost is the unary cost of the previous node + the pairwise cost to
   get to the current node + the unary cost of the current node, see below.
2. When we get to last column, find minimum
3. Trace back to see how we got there

$$
S_{n,k} = U_n(w_n = k) + \min_l \left[
S_{n-1,l} + P_n(w_n = k,w_{n-1} = l)
\right]
$$
