# Markov model

For [time-series](202210261714.md) data $v_1, \ldots, v_t$ we need to model
$P(v_{1:T})$. Consider the decomposition

$$
P(v_{1:T}) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} P(v_t|v_{1:t-1})
$$

The convention is $P(v_t|v_{1:t-1}) = P(v_1)$ for $t=1$

So we have

$$
P(v_{1:3}) = P(v_1) \cdot P(v_2|v_1) \cdot P(v_3|v_1, v_2)
$$

It is often natural to assume that the influence of the immediate past is more
relevant than the remote past and in Markov models only a limited number of
previous observations are required to predict the future.
