# Baum-Welch algorithm

Recall from [Hidden Markov models](202210261811.md):

  h1((h1))-->h2((h2))
  h1-->v1((v1))
  h2-->h3((h3))
  h2-->v2((v2))
  h3-- ... -->ht((ht))
  h3-->v3((v3))
  ht-->vt((vt))
```

We use a transmission matrix $A$ to denote the probability of transitioning from
$h_i$ to $h_j$ and we use an emission matrix $B$ to denote the probability of 
observing $v_j$ given a state $h_j$ 

Baum-Welch is a type of [expectation maximization](202210250932.md) for HMM, for
each step of Baum-Welch need to use [Forward-Backward algorithm](202211241752.md)
to estimate the forward and backward probabilities at each time step. It uses
those fit the model parameters.
