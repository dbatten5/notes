# Smoothing splines

Similar to [regression splines](202211250920.md), but we make a knot at every
training point. We'll also want to penalise fitted functions that are "too
wiggly":

$$
\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y^{(i)} - f(x^{(i)}))^2 + \lambda \int f''(t)^2 dt
$$

Useful if you need to fit many nonlinear curves.
