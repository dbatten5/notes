# Conjugate distributions

These pairs have a special relationship, they are conjugate distributions:
- [Beta distribution](202210091028.md) is conjugate to [Bernoulli distribution](202210081016.md)
- [Dirichlet distribution](202210091107.md) is conjugate to [Categorical distribution](202210091049.md)
- [Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution](202210091117.md) is conjugate to [Univariate normal distribution](202210091114.md)
- [Normal Inverse Wishart Distribution](202210101311.md) is conjugate to [Multivariate Normal distribution](202210101307.md)

When we take the product of a distribution and its conjugate, the result has the same
form as the conjugate.

E.g. multiplying a Bernoulli distribution by a Beta distribution gives a new
Beta, with new parameters.
