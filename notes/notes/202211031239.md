# Triangulation

In a triangulated graph, every loop of length 4 must have a chord (a shortcut).
Such graphs are called *decomposable*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  a((a)) --- b((b)) & f((f))
  e --- d((d))
  b --- e((e)) & c((c))
  d --- c
  f --- e
```

This is a non-decomposable graph. Adding edges from $a$ to $e$ and $b$ to $d$
makes it a triangulated version.

The process of triangulation via variable elimination is:
* repeat:
* select any non-deleted node $x$ in the graph
* add links to all the neighbours of $x$
* node $x$ is then deleted
* until all nodes have been deleted
