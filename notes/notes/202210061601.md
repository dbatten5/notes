# Fields

The collection of events can be thought of as a subcollection $\mathcal{F}$ of
the set of all subsets of $\Omega$ such that:
1. if $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ then $A \cup B \in \mathcal{F}$ and $A \cap B \in
   \mathcal{F}$
2. if $A \in \mathcal{F}$ then $A^{c} \in \mathcal{F}$
3. $\empty \in \mathcal{F}$
Any collection which satisfies the above properties is a  *field.* It follows
that 
$$
\text{if } A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n \in \mathcal{F} \enspace \text{then} \enspace
\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \in \mathcal{F}
$$

In other words, $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under finite union, and also
intersection. When dealing with infinite $\Omega$ as is often the case, we
require that $\mathcal{F}$ be closed under countable union. A collection of
subsets with these properties is called a *[$\sigma$-field](202210061621.md)*.
