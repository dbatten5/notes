# Forward-backward algorithm

To calculate the probabilities and likelihoods in a [HMM](202210261811.md), can
use the forward algorithm:

$$
\alpha_t(j) = P(\bold{x}_{1:t},z_t=j) = 
\sum_{i}^{k} \alpha_{t-1}(i) a_{i,j} P(\bold{x}_t;\boldsymbol{\theta}_j)
$$

This considers all the evidence up to time $t$. The forward-backward algorithm
considers evidence of the past and the future (known as smoothing). It computes
the $\alpha_i$ using the forward algorithm as above, but then also does a
backward pass:

$$
\beta_t(j) = P(\bold{x}_{t:T},z_t=j) = 
\sum_{i}^{k} \beta_{t+1}(i) a_{i,j} P(\bold{x}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_j)
$$
