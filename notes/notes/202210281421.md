# F statistic

$$
F = \frac{(TSS - RSS)/p}{RSS/(n - p - 1)}
$$

With $n$ the number of samples, $p$ the number of covariates, $RSS$ being the
[residual sum of squares](202210111531.md):

$$
RSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y^{(i)} - \hat{y}(i))^2
$$

And $TSS$ being the total sum of squares:

$$
TSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y^{(i)} - \overline{y})^2
$$
