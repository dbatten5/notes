# Relevance vector classification

Apply a sparse prior to [dual](202211011453.md) variables:

$$
Pr(\boldsymbol{\psi}) = \prod_{i=1}^{I} \text{Stud}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_i}\left[ 0, 1, \nu \right]
$$

That is, of all the training examples out there, we want most to have a very low
(or 0) weighting (sparsity).

Useful for fine-tuning models as this tells us which training examples are very
useful, and should therefore be kept hold of.

Similar concept to [support vector machines](202210210933.md) but thought of as
more advanced for two reasons:
* offers probabilistic interpretation (SVM only offers a decision boundary)
* can be used for classification of $\ge 2$ classes (SVM only works with binary)
