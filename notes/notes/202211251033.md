# Local regression

Build a model around the prediction point you are interested. The main idea is
to fit least-squares around a point by nonlinearly reweighting the data around it.

## Algorithm

For local regression at $X = x_0$

1. Gather the fraction $s = k/n$ training points whose $x_i$ are closest to $x_0$
2. Assign a weight $K_{i0} = K(x_i,x_0)$ to each point in this neighbourhood, so
   that the point furthest from $x_0$ has weight zero, and the closest has the
   highest weight. All but these $k$ nearest neighbours get weight zero.
3. Fit a weighted least squares regression of the $y_i$ on the $x_i$ using the
   aforementioned weights, by finding $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that
   minimize

   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} K_{i0}(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_i)^2
   $$

4. The fitted value at $x_0$ is given by $\hat{f}(x_0) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1x_0$
