# De Morgan's Law

The complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their
complements.
$$
(A \cup B)^{c} = A^{c} \cap B^{c}
$$

The complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their
complements.
$$
(A \cap B)^{c} = A^{c} \cup B^{c}
$$

This also allows to define the intersection in terms of the union and vice versa
$$
A \cap B = (A^{c} \cup B^{c})^{c} \\
A \cup B = (A^{c} \cap B^{c})^{c}
$$

This then allows us manipulate the probabilities like so:
$$
P(A \cap B) = 1 - P(A^{c} \cup B^{c}) \\
P(A \cup B) = 1 - P(A^{c} \cap B^{c})
$$
