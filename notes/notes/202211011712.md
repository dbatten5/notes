# Hessian matrix

A matrix of 2nd order differentials.

For 2 variables:

$$
\bold{H}_f = \begin{bmatrix} 
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} \\[0.5em]
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

Note that $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}$ means first differentiate
by $x$, then by $y$.
