# Ransac

A way to fit with more robustness for outliers (than e.g. least squares)

1. Randomly choose a minimal subset of the data.
2. Use this subset to estimate the parameters.
3. Compute the number of inliers for this model.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 a fixed number of times.
5. Re-estimate the model using inliers from the best fit.

Essentially it's finding a number of solutions, seeing which solution is "best"
(based on how many datapoints agree with the solution), then selecting that best
solution.
