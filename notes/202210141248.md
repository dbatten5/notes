# Multiclass

A way of categorising variables into different classes.

This can be achieved by using many different binary classifiers and figuring
which one wins. A popular way of doing this is the [one-vs-rest
approach](202210141255.md). An alternative, but more expensive approach, is the
[one-vs-one approach](202210141257.md).
