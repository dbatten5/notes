# Posterior distribution

### Example

Two fair dice are rolled. Someone tells you that the sum of the two scores is 9.
What is the distribution of the dice scores?

The score of the die $a$ is denoted $s_a$ with $\text{dom}(s_a) = \text{dom}(s_b) = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.
The three variables involved are then $s_a, s_b$ and the total score, $t = s_a + s_b$. A model of these three variables naturally takes the form 
$$
p(t,s_a,s_b) = \underbrace{p(t|s_a,s_b)}_{\text{likelihood}}\underbrace{p(s_a,s_b)}_{\text{prior}}
$$
The prior $p(s_a,s_b)$ is the join probability of score $s_a$ and the $s_b$
without knowing anything else. Assuming independency, 
$$
p(s_a,s_b) = p(s_a)p(s_b)
$$
Since the dice are fair, $p(s_a) = p(s_b) = \frac{1}{6}$.

Here the likelihood term is 
$$
p(t|s_a,s_b) = \mathbb{I}[t = s_a + s_b]
$$

with $\mathbb{I}$ being the indicator function. The complete model is then 
$$
p(t,s_a,s_b) = p(t|s_a,s_b)p(s_a)p(s_b)
$$

The posterior is then given by 
$$
p(s_a, s_b|t = 9) = \frac{p(t = 9|s_a,s_b)p(s_a)p(s_b)}{p(t=9)}
$$
