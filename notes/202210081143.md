# Random vectors

$X$ and $Y$ are random variables. When thinking about their properties relative
to each other, it's helpful to thing of them as components of a 'random vector'
$(X, Y)$ taking values in $\Reals^2$.

The [joint distribution function](202210081156) of a random vector $(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)$ is the
quantity $P(X_1 \le x_1, X_2 \le x_2, \ldots, X_n \le x_n)$
