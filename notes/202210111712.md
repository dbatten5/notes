# Basis expansion

Models fitted from transformed data can still be [linear models](2022101114).
Any model that can be expressed as a weighted sum of arbitrary fixed functions
of the input is a linear model and can be fitted by modelling least squares.
This transformation means that these inputs occupy a feature space with a
different basis. 

### Example

Consider a frequency signal. Suppose we decompose the signal with 3 basis
functions:
$$
\begin{align*}
  h_1(x) &= \sin(x) \\
  h_2(x) &= \sin(2x) \\
  h_3(x) &= \sin(3x)
\end{align*}
$$

When we attempt to fit a signal, we will be estimating the amount of each $h_i$
in the signal, e.g. for $y = 4h_1 + 2h_2 + 3h_3$, the fitted weights are 
$\left( 4, 2, 3 \right)$.
