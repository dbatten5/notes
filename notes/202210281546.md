# Interactions between variables

There could be a "synergy" effect between variables in a
[linear model](202210111445.md). E.g. spending more money on radio advertising
could "change the slope" for TV advertising, if the extra exposure makes people
pay more attention to TV adverts.

This can be achieved by multiplication:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_{12}x_1x_2 + \epsilon
$$
