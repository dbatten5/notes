# Bernoulli distribution

$$
\begin{align*}
  P(x = 0) &= 1-\lambda \\[0.5em]
  P(x = 1) &= \lambda \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$
or 
$$
P(x) = \lambda^x(1-\lambda)^{1-x}
$$

For short, we write 
$$
P(x) = \text{Bern}_x[\lambda]
$$

A Bernoulli distribution describes situations where only two possible outcomes
$y=0/y=1$ of failure/success.

Takes a single parameter $\lambda \in [0,1]$.

When we don't know the exact value for $\lambda$ (likely to be often), then we
want to think of $\lambda$ as taking on a range of values with an associated
probability, ie. a distribution. One such distribution is known as the [Beta distribution](202210091028).
