# Collider

A collider contains two or more incoming arrows along a chosen path. E.g., if
$C$ has more than one incoming link, e.g. one from each of $A$ and $B$, then $A$
and $B$ and not independent given $C$.

If $C$ has at most one incoming link, e.g. one from $A$ but not from $B$, then
$A$, then $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$. In this case
$C$ is called a *non-collider*.
