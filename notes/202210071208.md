# Independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if
$$
P(A, B) = P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

This implies that
$$
P(A|B) = P(A) \\[0.5em]
P(B|A) = P(B)
$$

Written $A \perp B$

### Example

Suppose you have two sensors, a left sensor $l$ and a right sensor $r$. Each
sensor can be in an "off" or an "on" state. The probability distribution looks
like this
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\begin{array}{cccc}
& & \text{r} & & \\
& & \text{off} & \text{on} & \\
\text{l} & \text{off} & 0.1 & 0.6 \\
& \text{on} & 0.2 & 0.1 \\
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

Is $l \perp r$? Answer, no.

We know that $p(l) = [0.7, 0.3]$ and $p(r) = [0.3, 0.7]$. Therefore,
$$
\begin{align*}
p(l = \text{on})p(r = \text{on}) &= 0.7 * 0.3 \\
& = 0.21
\end{align*}
$$
and

$$
\begin{align*}
 p(l = \text{on}, r=\text{on}) &= 0.1
\end{align*}
$$

Since $0.21 \neq 0.1$, we know that $l$ and $r$ are not independent.

The other way to spot this is realising that if the two random variables are
independent then the matrix that forms the joint distribution has to have rank 1
(all rows are linearly dependent). This matrix has rank 2 $\rArr$ not independent.
