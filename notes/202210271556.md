# R2 (R-squared) statistic

$R^2$ is a way of assessing model fit.

Related to the [residual sum of squares](202210111531.md). $R^2$ is a proportion
statistic: the proportion of [variance](202210081517.md) of $Y$ explained by 
$\bold{X}$. It always takes values between 0 and 1.

A large $R^2$ is usually a good sign (but not enough by itself).

$$
R^2 \equiv \frac{TSS - RSS}{TSS}
$$

Where

$$
\begin{align*}
RSS &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y^{(i)} - \hat{y}(i))^2 \\[0.5em]
TSS &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y^{(i)} - \overline{y})^2 \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$

$TSS$ is the *total sum of squares*: how far the data is from its mean.

Note that $R^2 \rightarrow 0$ as $\text{var}(X) \rightarrow 0$ and $R^2 \rightarrow 1$
as $\text{var}(X) \rightarrow \infty$
