# Wald test

A form of [hypothesis testing](202210150928.md). This uses the same
[statistic](202210101627.md) as the [t-test](202210151447.md), but the interpretation
is different, and as a result the distribution of the test statistic also
differs:
- samples can be from "any" distribution
- sample sizes assumed to be "big enough" that the [CLT](202210151509.md) applies
- the distribution of the test statistic is therefore $\text{Norm}(0,1)$
