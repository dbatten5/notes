# Clique tree

A clique tree is a singly connected clique graph.

Consider a [Markov network](202210201118.md):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  x1((x1)) --- x4((x4)) --- x3((x3)) & x2((x2))
```

With a joint distribution of
$p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = \phi(x_1, x_4)\phi(x_2, x_4)\phi(x_3, x_4)$.

This can be represented with a [clique graph](202211031127.md)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  x1x4([x1,x4]) --- x41[x4] & x42[x4]
  x41 --- x3x4([x3,x4])
  x42 --- x2x4([x2,x4])
  x3x4 --- x43[x4] --- x2x4
```

The clique graph of this singly-connected Markov net is multiply-connected,
where the separator potentials are all set to unity.

For [absorption](202211031203.md) to work, we need a singly-connected clique
graph.

To do this we need to reexpress the Markov net in terms of marginals. Can be
shown that

$$
p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = \frac{p(x_1, x_4)p(x_2,x_4)p(x_3,x_4)}
{p(x_4)p(x_4)}
$$

Which is represented by the clique graph

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  x1x4([x1,x4]) --- x41[x4] & x42[x4]
  x41 --- x3x4([x3,x4])
  x42 --- x2x4([x2,x4])
```

This means that if a variable (here $x_4$) occurs in every separator in a clique
graph loop one can remove that variable from an arbitrarily chosen separator in
the loop. Therefore, if a Markov net is singly connected, then we can form a
clique tree in this manner.
