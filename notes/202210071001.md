# Conditional probability

The conditional probability that $A$ occurs given that $B$ occurs is defined as
$P(A|B)$ and is the probability of $A$ and $B$ occurring divided by the
probability of $B$.

For $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ a [partition](202210071009) of $\Omega$ and all of
$B_i$ having some probability of happening, then the probability of $A$ is the
sum over $n$ of the probability of $A$ given $B_i$ times probability of $B_i$.

Taking $B, B^{c}$ as a partition of $\Omega$: 
$$
P(A) = P(A|B)P(B) + P(A|B^{c})P(B^{c})
$$
