# Dynamic programming

1. Work through graph computing minimum possible cost $S_{n,k}$ to reach each
   node. A cost is the unary cost of the previous node + the pairwise cost to
   get to the current node + the unary cost of the current node, see below.
2. When we get to last column, find minimum
3. Trace back to see how we got there

$$
S_{n,k} = U_n(w_n = k) + \min_l \left[
S_{n-1,l} + P_n(w_n = k,w_{n-1} = l)
\right]
$$
