# Predictive distribution

Suppose you have a model, we would like to know the probability of a new datum
$\bold{x}^*$ under the model. This is known as the evaluating the *predictive
distribution*. 3 methods are typically used:

- [Maximum likelihood](202210101331)
- [Maximum a posteriori (MAP)](202210101339)
- [Bayesian normal fitting](202210111043)
