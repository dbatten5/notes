# Conjugate distributions

These pairs have a special relationship, they are conjugate distributions:
- [Beta distribution](2022100910) is conjugate to [Bernoulli distribution](2022100810)
- [Dirichlet distribution](2022100911) is conjugate to [Categorical distribution](2022100910)
- [Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution](2022100911) is conjugate to [Univariate normal distribution](2022100911)
- [Normal Inverse Wishart Distribution](2022101013) is conjugate to [Multivariate Normal distribution](2022101013)

When we take the product of a distribution and its conjugate, the result has the same
form as the conjugate.

E.g. multiplying a Bernoulli distribution by a Beta distribution.
