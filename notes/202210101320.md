# Conjugate distributions

These pairs have a special relationship, they are conjugate distributions:
- [Beta distribution](2022100910) is conjugate to [Bernoulli distribution](2022100810)
- [Dirichlet distribution](2022100911) is conjugate to [Categorical distribution](202210091049)
- [Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution](202210091117) is conjugate to [Univariate normal distribution](202210091114)
- [Normal Inverse Wishart Distribution](202210101311) is conjugate to [Multivariate Normal distribution](202210101307)

When we take the product of a distribution and its conjugate, the result has the same
form as the conjugate.

E.g. multiplying a Bernoulli distribution by a Beta distribution.
