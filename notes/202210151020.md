# p-value

The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic, $X$, as or more
extreme than the value $x$ seen in the data, under the assumptions that the null
hypothesis, $H_0$, is true. If we get a very low p-value, it would suggest
that it was very unlikely that we received the sample we did based on the
assumption that $H_0$ was true, therefore we have evidence to reject $H_0$.

***p is low, null must go.***

It is **not** the probability of $H_0$ being true.

Can think of p-values as random variables since it is a function of a
realisation of a random variable (the distribution generated by our assumed
model).

When performing a [hypothesis test](202210150928.md), a large p-value may be caused
by:
1. $H_0$ may be true (or $H_0$ can't be rejected)
1. $H_0$ may be false, but the [power](202210151142.md) of our test is too low to
   detect this
