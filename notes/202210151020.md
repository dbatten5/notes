# p-value

The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic, $X$, as or more
extreme than the value $x$ seen in the data, under the assumptions that the null
hypothesis, $H_0$, is true.

It is **not** the probability of $H_0$ being true.

Can think of p-values as random variables.

When performing a [hypothesis test](202210150928), a large p-value may be caused
by:
1. $H_0$ may be true (or $H_0$ can't be rejected)
1. $H_0$ may be false, but the [power](202210151142) of our test is too low to
   detect this
