# Beta distribution

Defined over data $\lambda \in [0,1]$ (ie parameter of
[Bernoulli](202210081016)), ie. a [hyperparameter](202210061301).

$$
Pr(\lambda) = \frac{\Gamma[\alpha + \beta]}{\Gamma[\alpha] +
\Gamma[\beta]}\lambda^{\alpha - 1}(1 - \lambda)^{\beta - 1}
$$

For short, we write
$$
P(\lambda) = \text{Beta}_{\lambda}[\alpha,\beta], \enspace \alpha, \beta > 0
$$

The mean depends on relative values $\mathbb{E}[\lambda] = \alpha / (\alpha +
\beta)$.

The concentration depends on the magnitude.

For $\alpha = \beta = 1.0$, we get a flat distribution. This means that the
all the different "histograms" we get from the Bernoulli distribution are
equally likely to occur.

For $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that result in a peak around, eg. 0.37, ie. a low value
of $\lambda$, this means that the lower values of $\lambda$ are more likely,
therefore the Bernoulli distribution is more likely to be skewed towards a lower
$P(x = 1)$.
