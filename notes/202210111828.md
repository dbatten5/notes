# Ridge regression

A form of [penalisation](202210111821). A penalty applied to the model weights
takes the same form as the penalty on the residuals: $P(\bold{w}) =
\|\bold{w}\|^2$. This essentially means, make the weights as small as possible.

The updated loss function for a [ordinary least squares](202210111653) with this
penalty term is:
$$
\bold{w}^* = \argmin_{\bold{w}} \|\bold{X}\bold{w} - \bold{y}\|^2 + \lambda \|\bold{w}\|^2
$$

Solving for $\bold{w}^*$ gives us:
$$
\bold{w}^* = (\bold{X}^{\top}\bold{X} + \lambda \bold{I})^{-1}\bold{X}^{\top}\bold{y}
$$
