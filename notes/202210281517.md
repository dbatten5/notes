# Regression coefficients

Consider the following linear model

$$
Y = \beta_0 +  \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_kX_k + \epsilon
$$

With parameters $\beta_i$ fitted, e.g. 

$$
Y = 2.93 + 0.04x_1 + 0.19x_2 - 0.001x_3 + \epsilon
$$

When comparing coefficients, make sure to be aware of the scales of the $x_i$,
e.g. one could be in metres and the other could be in kilometres.

Also very dangerous saying that, if I increase $x_i$ by 1000, then, other things
being equal, I will increase $Y$ by 400, in expectation. This implies a *causal*
relationship; if I change $x$ then $y$ will happen. These models are much more
about correlation rather than causation.

Careful when referring to regression coefficients as "effects". Don't do it.

A more sober conclusion for the above, "Other budgets being equal, an
increase in $x_1$ of 1000 will **correspond** to an increase of $Y$ by 400, in
expectation."
