# Sample space

The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, denoted by $\Omega$.

For a tossed coin, there are two possible outcomes, denote by H for heads and T
for tails. Therefore $\Omega = \{\text{H}, \text{T}\}$.

For a regular die $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$.

We think of [events](202210061555.md) as subsets of the sample space $\Omega$.

The set $\Omega$ is also known as the certain event, since some member of
$\Omega$ is guaranteed to happen.
