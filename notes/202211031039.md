# Smoothing

Inferring the past, i.e. given some observed variable states, what was the
probability of having some hidden state.

$$
\begin{align*}
p(h_t|v_{1:T}) &\propto p(h_t,v_{1:T}) \\[0.5em]
&= \underbrace{p(h_t,v_{1:t})}_{\alpha_t(h_t)} \cdot
\underbrace{p(v_{t+1:T}|h_t)}_{\beta_t(h_t)} \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$

So we have $\alpha_t(h_t)$ which denotes the joint distribution of the current
(hidden) state and all the observations up to it.

And we have $\beta_t(h_t)$, the conditional probability of future observations
given the current (hidden) state. This can be found with [beta-recursion](202211031045.md).
