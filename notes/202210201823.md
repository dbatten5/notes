# Markov chain

Only the recent past is relevant:

$$
P(v_t|v_1, \ldots, v_{t-1}) = P(v_t|v_{t-L}, \ldots, v_{t-1})
$$

Where $L \ge 1$ is the order of the Markov chain. The order of a Markov chain
means the dependence on the history. A first order Markov property says that the
future state depends only on the current, second says that the future depends on
current state and the previous state.

$$
P(v_{1:T}) = P(v_1)P(v_2|v_1)P(v_3|v2) \ldots P(v_T|v_{T-1})
$$

A Markov chain is stationary if the transitions $P(v_t = s'|v_{t-1} = s) = f(s',
s)$ are time-independent

$$
P(v_1, \ldots, v_T) = \underbrace{P(v_1)}_{\text{initial}}\prod_{t=2}^{T} \underbrace{P(v_t|v_{t-1})}_{\text{transition}}
$$
