# Marginal inference

Given a distribution $p(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, *inference* is the process of
computing functions of the distribution.

*Marginal inference* is concerned with the computation of the distribution of a
subset of variables, possibly conditioned on another subset.

For example, given a join distribution $p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ and evidence
$x_1 = \text{tr}$, a marginal inference calculation is

$$
p(x_5|x_1 = \text{tr}) \propto \sum_{x_2, x_3, x_4} p(x_1 = \text{tr},x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)
$$
