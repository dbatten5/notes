# Convolution

Provides a way to combine two function to output a third function

$$
(f * g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau) g(t-\tau) d\tau
$$

Where
* $f$ is a *[filter](202211031401.md)* or *kernel*
* $g$ is the *input signal*

Convolutions occur when some spatial or temporal effect (e.g. reverberation or
optical blurring) applies everywhere over another signal - the blur or echo at
each point smears into the blur or echo from every other point.

For discrete signals this becomes essentially a *sliding window* dot product. A
local signal fragment is dotted with the input signal at every offset.
