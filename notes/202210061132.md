# Machine Learning

A collection of techniques or a toolbox to have a programme be determined by data.

Important that we don't test a model on data that it has already seen. With that
in mind, the dataset is often split into two, a training set and a test set.
Of course, we need enough data in the training set to properly train the model.
Typically it'll be around 80% of the data in the training set and 20% in the
test set.

Often want to check our code works, tune our hyperparameters, etc. Typically
another chunk is reserved for that purpose, known as a validation set. Split
could be 70% for training, 10% for validation and 20% for testing.
