# Composite hypothesis

A null hypothesis can postulate more than one value for the target state of
nature, for example: 
$$
H_0: \theta \ge 0.5 \\[0.5em]
H_1: \theta < 0.5 \\[0.5em]
$$

This is known as a **composite hypothesis**. Where $H_0$ specifies a single
value, it is referred to as a **simple hypothesis**.
