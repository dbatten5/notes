# Statistical inference

Starting with some data, asking what are the models that could have generated
this data? E.g. maybe we have some data that looks like a Gaussian distribution,
what is the [mean](2022100815) and the [standard deviation](202210081525).

Used to characterise a population.

### Example

For a population of $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{10000}\}$, a sample might be the first
100 observations of the population $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{100}\}$ and a statistic
might be the mean of that sample space $\frac{1}{100}\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i$.
Could then use inference to infer that the mean for our model for the population
$N(\mu, 1)$ (Normal distribution) is the same as the mean for the sample.
