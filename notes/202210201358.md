# Sample mean

Denoted $\overline{X}$, it is a random variable since it is a function of the
data

$$
\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
$$

And we have that

$$
E\left[ \overline{X} \right] = E \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right] =
\mu
$$

For this reason we can consider $\overline{X}$ to be a plausible estimator of
$\mu$, denoted $\hat{\mu} = \overline{X}$.
