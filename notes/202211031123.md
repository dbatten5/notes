# Junction tree algorithm

The JTA deals with [marginal inference](202211050932.md) in multiply-connected
structures. It can handle both [belief networks](202210131116.md) and [Markov
networks](202210201118.md).

The algorithm looks like so:
* **Moralisation**. Marry unmarried parents, only required for directed
distributions. Make sure that *all* parents of a variable are married.
* **[Triangulation](202211031239.md)**.
* **Junction Tree**. Form a junction tree from cliques of the triangulated
graph, removing any unnecessary links in a loop on the clique graph. This can be
achieved by finding a tree with maximal spanning weight with weight $w_{ij}$
given by the number of variables in the separator between cliques $i$ and $j$.
* **Potential Assignment**. Assign potentials to junction tree cliques and set
the separator potentials to unity.
* **Message Propagation**. Carry out [absorption](202211031203.md) until updates
have been passed along both directions of every link on the JT.

The clique marginals can then be read off the from the JT.
