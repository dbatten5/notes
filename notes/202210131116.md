# Belief networks (Bayesian networks)

A DAG in which each node is associated with the conditional probability of the
node given its parents.

The joint distribution is obtained by taking the product of the conditional
probabilities:

$$
p(A,B,C,D,E) = p(A)p(B)p(C|A,B)p(D|C)p(E|B,C)
$$

Note that $p(A,B,C,D,E)$ is a distribution.
