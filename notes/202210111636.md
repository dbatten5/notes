# Error term

Often a model needs to account for errors, and these errors are often packaged
up in an *error term*, typically denoted with $\epsilon$.

When we add an error term to a model, and assuming it takes on a Gaussian
distribution, then the output is no longer deterministic, it becomes a [random
variables](202210071534).
