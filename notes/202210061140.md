# Models

A representation of some real world phenomenom, usually lacking some form of
accuracy. Essentially it's just a function:
$$
\bold{y} = f(\bold{x})
$$
Where $\bold{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ is the input data, features etc. and
$\bold{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]$ are the outputs, predictions, inference etc.

Having too many parameters in the model is in some ways "cheating", makes the
model too flexible. Can fit the data better without having any better
explanatory power, known as [overfitting](202210061205).

Every model falls into one of three categories:
- Model contingency of the world on the data $P(\bold{w}|\bold{x})$ ([Discriminative](202210171323))
- Model joint occurrence of the world and data $P(\bold{x},\bold{w})$ ([Generative](202210171325))
- Model contingency of data on world $P(\bold{x}|\bold{w})$ ([Generative](202210171325))

Which types of model to use?

1. Generative models model data - costly and many aspects of data may have no
   influence on world state
2. Inference simple in discriminative model
3. Data really is generated from world - generative matches this
4. If missing data, then generative preferred
5. Generative allows imposition of prior knowledge specified by user
