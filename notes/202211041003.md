# Kullback-Leibler divergence

KL divergence between two [pmfs](202210071722.md) "p" and "q" is defined as

$$
KL(p||q) \equiv \sum_{y} p(y) \log \frac{p(y)}{q(y)}
$$

For $y$ where $p(y) > 0$. It measures the "distance" between two pmfs.

Note that this is never negative, and equals zero if and only if $p(y) = q(y)$
for all $y$.
