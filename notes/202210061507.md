# Regularisation

A process of attempting to mitigate [overfitting](202210061205). This encourages
fitting of the true regularities of the data, as opposed to random fluctuations.
However, there's no definite way to separate noise from training data.

A simple form of regularisation is reducing the number of features of the model,
or by setting the weights of "less important" features to 0, a form of [feature selection](202210111808).
