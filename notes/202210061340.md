# Supervised Learning

If the "Y"s are known, ie. the outputs of a model, both in terms of the general
kind of output as well as specific values of outputs, then this is known as
supervised learning. In other words, you have something available at training
time which will tell you if you're right or wrong.

Supervised learning is probably the most straightforward and widecommon type of
ml. However, having these labelled data training sets typically requires some
sort of human input, therefore it can be slow or expensive to acquire.
