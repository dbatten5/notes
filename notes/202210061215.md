# Fitting

Finding the best parameters for a [model](202210061140).

It's important to know how uncertain we are about the fit. This uncertainty is
represented as a probability distribution over the parameters of the fitted
model. So for each distribution used for modelling, there is a second
distribution over the associated parameters. E.g., we use a [normal
distribution](202210091114) to model some phenomena. The normal has the
parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$, how do we know which are the best parameters to
choose for our data?
