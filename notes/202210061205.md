# Overfitting

Having too many parameters in the model is in some ways "cheating", makes the
model too flexible. Can fit the data better without having any better
explanatory power.

In other words, tuning the model too closely to the training data.

Attempts to mitigate overfitting are known as [regularisation](202210061507.md).
