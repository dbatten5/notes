# Gibbs sampling

An example of a [Markov chain Monte Carlo](202211151043.md) form of sampling 
from an undirected graph.

To generate new sample $\bold{x}$ in the chain
* Sample each dimension in any order
* To update $n^{th}$ dimension $x_n$
  * Fix other $N-1$ dimensions
  * Draw from conditional distribution $P(x_n|x_{1..N \setminus n})$

Get sample by selecting from chain
* Needs burn-in period
* Choose samples spaced apart, so not correlated
