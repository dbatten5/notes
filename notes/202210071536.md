# Distribution function

The distribution function of a random variable $X$ is the function $F:\Reals
\rightarrow [0,1]$ given by $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.

QUESTION:
given that discrete variables often have no way to compare values between
themselves, eg. red balls and blue balls, why is there an inequality in the
definition of the distribution function above?

The distribution function of a random variable $X$ tells us about the values
taken by $X$ and their relative likelihoods, rather than about the sample space
and the collection of events.

A distribution function has the following properties:
1. $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}F(x) = 0, \medspace \lim\limits_{x \to \infty}F(x) = 1$
2. if $x < y$ then $F(x) \leq F(y)$
3. $F$ is right-continuous, $F(x+h) \rightarrow F(x)$ as $h \downarrow 0$

Some more useful properties:
1. $P(X \gt x) = 1 - F(x)$
2. $P(x \lt X \leq y) = F(y) - F(x)$
3. $P(X = x) = F(x) - \lim\limits_{y \uparrow x}F(y)$

The function $g(F(x))$ is a distribution function whenever $g$ is continuous and
non-decreasing on $[0,1]$, with $g(0) = 0$, $g(1) = 1$.

For discrete [random variables](202210071534.md), the distribution function is
known as a [Probability mass function](202210071722.md).

For continuous random variable, the distribution function is
known as a [Probability density function](202210071723.md).

Distributions always sum to 1 over $\Omega$ and are always non negative.
