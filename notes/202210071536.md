# Distribution function

The distribution function of a random variable $X$ is the function $F:\Reals
\rightarrow [0,1]$ given by $F(x) = P(X \leq x)$.

The distribution function of a random variable $X$ tells us about the values
taken by $X$ and their relative likelihoods, rather than about the sample space
and the collection of events.

A distribution function has the following properties:
1. $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}F(x) = 0, \medspace \lim\limits_{x \to \infty}F(x) = 1$
2. if $x < y$ then $F(x) \leq F(y)$
3. $F$ is right-continuous, $F(x+h) \rightarrow F(x)$ as $h \downarrow 0$

Some more useful properties:
1. $P(X \gt x) = 1 - F(x)$
2. $P(x \lt X \leq y) = F(y) - F(x)$
3. $P(X = x) = F(x) - \lim\limits_{y \uparrow x}F(y)$

For discrete [random variables](202210071534), the distribution function is
known as a [Probability mass function](202210071722).

For continuous random variable, the distribution function is
known as a [Probability density function](202210071723).
