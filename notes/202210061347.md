# Unsupervised Learning

This is when we do not have "labels" for our training data. The model will have
to pull out patterns in the data and use that to try to classify the data. 

If labels are present, but they're not in much detail or just not very good,
this is known as **weakly supervised learning***.

If labels are present for some portion of the data but a larger amount of data
is unlabelled, this is known as [semi-supervised learning.](202210061351)
