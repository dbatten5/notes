# Hyperparameters

Fitting a model involves making choices, eg how many nearest neighbours, how
many trees in a random forest. These are not parameters of a model, but
parameters of a process used to determine a model and are known as a
hyperparameters. They are not learned, they are set by some other means. Having
lots of hyperparameters is often considered a disadvantage
