# Hidden (latent) variables

A hidden variable $\bold{h}_i$ is associated with each data point $\bold{x}_i$
and induces the more complex properties of the resulting pdf.

These are used to model complex probability density functions over the variable
$\bold{x}$, and may be discrete or continuous.

We describe the final density $P(\bold{x})$ as the [marginalization](202210091450)
of the joint density $P(\bold{x}, \bold{h})$ between $\bold{x}$ and $\bold{h}$
so that

$$
P(\bold{x}) = \int P(\bold{x}, \bold{h}) \hspace{0.2em} d\bold{h}
$$

And we can now focus on describing the joint density $P(\bold{x}, \bold{h})$.
Whatever form we choose for the joint distribution, it will have some parameters
$\boldsymbol{\theta}$, and so really we should write
$$
\underbrace{P(\bold{x}| \boldsymbol{\theta})}_{\text{likelihood}} = \int P(\bold{x}, \bold{h}| \boldsymbol{\theta}) \hspace{0.2em}  d\bold{h}
$$
