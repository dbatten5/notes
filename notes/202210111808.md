# Feature selection

A form of [regularisation](202210061507.md). In this scenario, different models are
generating with varying numbers of features. The performance of the models are
then tested (using e.g. [cross validation](202210111811.md), or with a dedicated
[validation set](202210061315.md)) and then a criterion that trades off the number
of parameters against the performance is applied.
