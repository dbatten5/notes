# Normal inverse gamma distribution

This distribution is defined over a pair of continuous variables $\mu,
\sigma^2$, the first of which can take any value and the second which is
constrained to be positive. It can therefore define a distribution over the mean
and variance parameter of a [normal distribution](202210091114).

$$
P(\mu, \sigma^2) =
\frac{\sqrt{\gamma}}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}
\frac{\beta ^ {\alpha}}{\Gamma[\alpha]}
\left( \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \right)^{\alpha + 1}
\exp \left[ 
- \frac{2\beta + \gamma(\delta - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}
\right]
$$
