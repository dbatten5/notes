# Normal inverse gamma distribution

This distribution is defined over a pair of continuous variables $\mu,
\sigma^2$, the first of which can take any value and the second which is
constrained to be positive. It can therefore define a distribution over the mean
and variance parameter of a [normal distribution](202210091114).
