# Setting a significance level

We may define a rule under which we reject $H_0$, e.g. if the probability of
obtaining an outcome as or more extreme than that observed is < or = to 0.05
under the assumption that $H_0$ is true.

This provides two things to consider:
- The [p-value](202210151020) itself is a random variable giving the smallest
  level which the test would reject the null hypothesis
- How does the probability of the p-value being less than 0.05 vary depending 
  upon the manner in which $H_0$ is false?

If you increase the level of the test, you increase the size of the critical
region and make it easier to distinguish $H_0$ from the alternatives, that is,
it reduces the probability of a Type II error (by allowing for more Type I
errors).

Similarly, if you decrease the level of the test, you reduce the size of the
critical region and make it more difficult to distinguish $H_0$ from the
alternatives, that is, it reduces the probability of a Type I error (by allowing
for more Type II errors).

In essence, a higher level yields a higher [power](202210151142).
