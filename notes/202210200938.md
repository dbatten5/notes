# Student t-distribution

Similar to the [normal distribution](202210091114), has a mean and a variance
but also has a $\nu$, which affects the shape of the curve. Generally speaking,
student t-distributions are more accommodating of outliers.

Define a hidden variable $h$:

$$
\begin{align*}
  P(\bold{x}|h) &= \text{Norm}_x\left[ \boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}/h \right]  \\[0.5em]
  \underbrace{P(h)}_{\text{prior}} &= \text{Gam}_h \left[ \nu/2, \nu/2 \right]  \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$
