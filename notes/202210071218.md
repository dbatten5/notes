# Conditional independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are [conditionally independent](202210071218.md) given $C$ if

$$
P(A, B \medspace | \medspace C) = P(A \medspace | \medspace C)P(B \medspace | \medspace C)
$$
and 
$$
P(A|B, C) = P(A|C)
$$

That is, extra information about $B$ doesn't affect the probability of $P(A|C)$
(since $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent).
