# Conditional independence

Events $A$ and $B$ are [conditionally independent](202210071218) given $C$ if

$$
P(A, B \medspace | \medspace C) = P(A \medspace | \medspace C)P(B \medspace | \medspace C)
$$
and 
$$
P(A|B, C) = P(A|C)
$$

That is, if the probability of $A$ and $B$ happening given $C$ is the probability
of $A$ given $C$ times the probability of $B$ given $C$, then $A$ and $B$ are
conditionally independent given $C$.
