# Markov equivalence

Two [graphs](202210191454) represent the same set of independence assumptions if
and only if they have the same [skeleton](202210191745) and the same set of
[immoralities](202210191746).

The following two graphs are **not** Markov equivalent:

```dot
digraph G {
  rankdir="LR";

  A -> B;
  B -> C;
  B -> D;
  C -> D;
  E -> D;
}
```

```dot
digraph G {
  rankdir="LR";

  C -> B;
  D -> B;
  E -> D;
  C -> D;
  B -> A;
}
```

They have the same skeleton, but the first graph has an immorality $\left\{ D,
E, B \right\}$, which the second graph does not have.
