# Statistical power

[Hypothesis testing](202210150928) involves a trade-off between two drawbacks:
- False positives: rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (Type I errors)
- False negatives: not rejecting $H_0$ when it is false (Type II errors)
- Note that not rejecting $H_0$ is not the same as accepting $H_0$

The power of a hypothesis test is the probability of avoiding a false negative
(Type II error). In other words, it's the probability of correctly rejecting
the null hypothesis when it is false. Choosing a text with maximal power may be
one criterion to answer a question.

- The power of the test varies with sample size
- The power of the test also varies with the level of the test

When we talk about a trade-off, usually it's the balance between the power and
the level at a fixed sample size.

$$
\text{Power } = P(X \in CR|\theta)
$$

Where $CR$ denotes the critical region. Some sample values:

$$
\begin{align*}
  P(X \in CR|\theta = 0.2) &= 0.992 \\
  P(X \in CR|\theta = 0.3) &= 0.87 \\
  P(X \in CR|\theta = 0.45) &= 0.133 \\
\end{align*}
$$
