# Random variables

A function mapping $\Omega$ into $\Reals$. More precisely, it has the property
that $\{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \leq x\} \in \mathcal{F}$ for each $x \in
\Reals$. Therefore to show that $Y$ is a random variable, need to show that 

Every random variable has a [distribution function](202210071536).

Describes a way to map outcomes of random processes to numbers.

Eg. for a coin flip $X = 1$ if heads, and $X = 0$ if tails. Note that it doesn't
have to be 1 and 0 here, could really be any number. Another example, $Y =$ the
sum of rolling 7 dice.

This allows us to express probabilities more concisely, eg. $P(Y \leq 30)$.

The smallest non-trivial random variable comes in the form of a [Bernoulli variable](202210081010).

The [domain](202210101028) of a random variable $\text{dom}(x)$ denotes the states $x$ can take.
