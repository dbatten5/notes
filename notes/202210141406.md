# k-Nearest neighbours

Consists taking a sample and comparing it to all of the other samples in the
training set, finding some number that it is most like, then using that to
predict the output value of that bit of data. Needs some metric of similarity,
or distance.

The hyperparameter $k$ is used to tune how many of the most similar samples we
use to contribute to the prediction. In general, increasing $k$ increases the
variance of the model.
