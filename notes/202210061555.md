# Event

Two events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint if $A \cap B = \empty$ where $\empty$ is
known as the **impossible set**.

Events $A$ and $B$ are [independent](202210071208) if 
$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)
$$

Events $A$ and $B$ are [conditionally independent](202210071218) given $C$ if
$$
P(A \cap B \medspace | \medspace C) = P(A \medspace | \medspace C)P(B \medspace | \medspace C)
$$
