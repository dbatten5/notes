# Loss Functions

The "heart" of machine learning. Tell us how good a model is (or how bad). They
provide a measure of "badness" that allow us to optimise it. Might look
something like
$$
L(\bold{x}, \bold{y}, \theta, f)
$$
Essentially they are a proxy to the task that we want to perform. Absolute value
is rarely import, much more relevant is the relative value.

Minimising a loss function is know as [optimisation](202210061228).
