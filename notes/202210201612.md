# Bootstrap pivotal interval

Here we use the bootstrap to estimate the distribution of $\hat{\theta}_n -
\theta$, which will be our [pivot](202210201406.md). Here, $\hat{\theta}_n$ is our
estimator for a certain parameter (could the sample mean) and $\theta$ is the
parameter for which we want to create an [interval](202210201346.md).

Let $H(r)$ be the [CDF](202210201626.md) of the pivot, so $H(r) = P(\hat{\theta} -
\theta \le r)$.

We define quantiles such that we get coverage $1 - \alpha$:

$$
P\left( a(\hat{\theta}_n) \le \theta \le b(\hat{\theta}_n)\right) = 1 - \alpha
$$

This is satisfied by 

$$
\begin{align*}
a(\hat{\theta}_n) &= \hat{\theta} - H^{-1}(1 - \alpha / 2) \\[0.5em]
b(\hat{\theta}_n) &= \hat{\theta} - H^{-1}(\alpha / 2)
\end{align*}
$$

Where $a$ and $b$ are the lower and upper bounds respectively, with
$\hat{\theta}_n$ being the estimate of $\theta$ using all the data in the
original sample. In order to determine the values of $a$ and $b$, we need to
determine the quantiles of $H$, by using the bootstrap.

We create bootstrapped pivots $R_{n,b}^* = \theta_{n,b}^* - \hat{\theta}_n$ of
$\hat{\theta}_n - \theta$, with $\theta_{n,b}^*$ being the $b^{th}$ bootstrap
estimate of $\theta$.

We can then estimate the quantile function, $\hat{H}^{-1}(\alpha) =
\theta_{n,B\alpha}^* - \hat{\theta}_n$. To do this we sort all $B$ bootstrap
pivots in ascending order and select the one in the position $B\alpha$, where
$B\alpha$ has been rounded to the nearest integer.
