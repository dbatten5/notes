# Variance

This measures the degree to which a random variable deviates from the mean.
Often denoted var($X$). The positive square root $\sigma = \sqrt{\text{var}(X)}$
is called the [standard deviation](202210081525).

In other notation, $\sigma_2 = \sigma^2$ where $\sigma_2$ is the variance and
$\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

Variance can also be written as
$$
\text{var}(X) = \mathbb{E}((X - \mathbb{E}X)^2) = \mathbb{E}(X)^2 - (\mathbb{E}X)^2
$$
Or, in other words, variance equals the mean of the square minus the square of
the mean.

Variances can never be negative.

### Properties of variance

- For a random variable $Y$ and a constant $c$, $\text{var}(\frac{Y}{c}) = \frac{1}{c^2}\text{var}(Y)$
