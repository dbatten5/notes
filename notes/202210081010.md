# Bernoulli variable

A random variable taking on two possible values, 0 and 1, with a [distribution function](202210071536)
$F(x) = P(X \leq x)$:
$$
F(x) = \begin{cases}
  0 & x < 0 \\
  1 - p & 0 \leq x \lt 1 \\
  1 & x \geq 1
\end{cases}
$$

$X$ is said to have a [Bernoulli distribution](202210081016), denoted by Bern($p$).

A particular class of Bernoulli variable is know as an [Indicator function](202210081017).
