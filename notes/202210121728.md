# Probabilistic reasoning

Equivalent to [inference](202210101619). Involves identifying all relevant
variables $x_1, \ldots, x_N$ in the environment, and making a probabilistic
model $p(x_1, \ldots, x_N)$ of their interaction. Reasoning is then performed by
introducing *evidence* that sets variables in known states, and subsequently
computing probabilities of interest, conditioned on this evidence.

### Example

People with X disease almost invariably ate hamburgers, $p(Hamburger Eater|X) =
0.9$. The probability of having X is low, about 1 in 100,000.

Assuming $p(Hamburger Eater) = 0.5$, what is the probability that a hamburger
eater will have X disease?
$$
\begin{align*}
p(X|Hamburger Eater) &= \frac{p(Hamburger Eater, X)}{p(Hamburger Eater)} \\[1.5em]
&= \frac{p(Hamburger Eater|X)P(X)}{p(Hamburger Eater)} \\[0.5em]
&= \frac{\frac{9}{10} * \frac{1}{100000}}{\frac{1}{2}} \\[0.5em]
&= \text{a very low number} \\[0.5em]
\end{align*}
$$

If $p(Hamburger Eater)$ was very small, then the probability calculated above
would be much higher. This is confirmed with intuition, since we can be more
sure that eating hamburgers is more related to the illness.
