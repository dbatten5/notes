# Akaike information criterion (AIC)

Useful as a criteria in the [best subset selection algorithm](202211171401.md).

$$
AIC(S) \equiv -2l(S) + 2|S|
$$

Where $l$ is the log likelihood using all data and $S$ is the number of
covariates.

For linear Gaussian models, AIC and [Mallow's Cp](202211171420.md) give the
exact same ranking of models.
