# Multivariate Normal distribution

Written as
$$
P(\bold{x}) = \text{Norm}_{\bold{x}}[\boldsymbol{\mu}, \bold{\Sigma}]
$$

- $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is a vector containing mean position
- $\bold{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix, a symmetric "positive definite"

Its hyperparameter distribution is modelled by the [Normal Inverse Wishart Distribution](202210101311).
It is its [conjugate](202210101320)
