# Multivariate normal distribution

Written as
$$
P(\bold{x}) = \text{Norm}_{\bold{x}}[\boldsymbol{\mu}, \bold{\Sigma}]
$$

- $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is a $D \times 1$ vector that describes the mean of the
  distribution, where $D$ is the number of dimensions.
- $\bold{\Sigma}$ is a symmetric, [positive definite](202210131406) $D \times D$ matrix, known as the [covariance](202210130950) matrix. This determines the shape of its iso-contours (rings).

Its hyperparameter distribution is modelled by the [Normal Inverse Wishart Distribution](202210101311).

When we [marginalize](202210091450) or take the [conditional](202210071001)
distribution of a normal with respect to a subset of variables, the result is
another normal.
